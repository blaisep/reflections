What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
  The .git diretory is created and the metadatafor the repo is stored there.
  To add files to the repo, you have to do a commit.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
  The staging area shows what is about to be committed, so you can change your mind and decide what to include or exclude in the commit.
