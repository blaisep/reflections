###When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  * The remote repo makes it easier to access the files from another machine
  * it's essential to collaborating with other peoplle

###Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Since Github is public, I might not be ready to share every element of my repo. I will probably want to polish up work-in-progress, for example.

###Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

  * Fork is a github construct describing when a repo is cloned from one account to another account on Github.
  * Clone is a separate copy of a repo.
  * Branch is an additional chain of commits _inside the same repo_ .

Use forks to copy Github repos and be able to send/recieve updates. Use clones when you need independent copies of repos. Use branches when you want to make changes to the same repo.

###What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?


  * Havng a local copy allows me to reconcile changes even if I don't hae an internet connection.


###How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

  * If it were all in a single document, then I would use Google Docs, but that would be difficult for text-only files.
  * I suppose another strategy would be to put files in staging directories and manually merge.
